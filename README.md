# dynamic-landing-page

I need a mutating landing page selling different imaginary device changing content every 10 seconds and automatically generating all those imaginary ideas. Should look with good UI/UX so people would love it's design. As for interactive elements, there should be only one button, clicking on which you will see a message that it's just a dummy website.
